### Installation

### Development

Modify

- Run from the root `pnpm install` to install dependancies
- Run from the root `pnpm run clean` to clean all apps directories (delete `dist` and `node_modules`) folders. Assume this is needed after pulling an updated version of the code from the remote repository.
- Run `pnpm run dev` from the corresponding `app` directory to start the server (`app`, `api`, `auth`, `admin` or `apps` for all);

Local ports:
| Service | Port |
| ------- | ----- |
| Portal | 3011 |
| App | 3010 |
| Admin | 3020 |
| Auth | 3030 |
| API | 3000 |
| Auth API| 3001 |

#### Suggested IDEA and plugins:

- [Restore Terminals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EthanSK.restore-terminals) (to spawn VSCode integrated terminals and run commands on startup)

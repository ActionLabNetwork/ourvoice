### Installation

> TBD

### Development

- Run from the root `pnpm install` to install dependancies
- Run from the root `pnpm run clean` to clean all apps directories (delete `dist` and `node_modules`) folders. Assume this is needed after pulling an updated version of the code from the remote repository.
- Run `pnpm run dev` from the corresponding `app` directory to start the server (`app`, `api` or `admin`);

#### Suggested IDEA and plugins:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Restore Terminals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EthanSK.restore-terminals) (to spawn VSCode integrated terminals and run commands on startup)

#### Prerequisites:

Follow the nuxt recommendations for [development setup](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation#prerequisites)

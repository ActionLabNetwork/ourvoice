# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. What are you trying to achieve with OURVOICE.app?

This specific deployment of [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) (authorised by the Faculty of Information Technology Education Leadership Team) is aiming to support the Town Hall meeting of sessional tutors and lecturers, to be held at 2pm on Wednesday 8 April, 2020. Questions, discussion points and proposals made in [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) will be provided to the hosts of the Town Hall meeting, as will follow-up contributions made through [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) after the meeting.

Research has shown that people are often reluctant to raise concerns or discuss workplace matters for fear of being labelled as a “difficult” or “uncooperative” colleague (or worse). Many people are worried that speaking out could have a negative consequence for their careers. Such fears, whether real or perceived, get in the way of creating the sort of inclusive and reflective workplace environment that the Faculty of Information Technology at ORGANISATION is seeking to achieve. [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) is an attempt to address this concern by providing a space where sessional tutors and lecturers can securely and anonymously raise and discuss workplace matters.

## 2. Is this a time-limited deployment?

Yes, this is a time limited deployment. This will last from Monday (th MONTH 20xx) to Friday (st MONTH 20xx). All SPECIFIC GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES AND STAKEHOLDERS at ORGANISATION will have access to the system. If you think that you should be able to access the system, but cannot do so, then please contact us using the [Feedback Form](./feedback) or mail [Dinislam Abdulgalimov](mailto:dinislam.abdulgalimov@monash.edu) directly.

## 3. Ok, how does that work?

To access [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) you simply need to enter your your ORGANISATION email address (there is no account to create or password to remember). The system then verifies this email as one that belongs to a sessional tutor or lecturer in the Faculty of Information Technology at ORGANISATION, and then sends a private link to that email account. The private link allows you to securely and anonymously access [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/). The link can only be used once and will allow you to anonymously read and/or submit messages and comments. To access [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) again you simply re-enter your email to generate a new private link. You can change the email account that private links are sent to, for example, from your Monash email to a personal email, by visiting the “[Settings](../system/settings)” page once you have accessed the system for the first time. When you access the system using the one-time private link, you can read others’ messages and comments, submit your own messages and comments, vote content up and down and participate in polls (if we use these in this deployment).

## 4. Are all my messages and comments immediately posted on the system?

No, all posts (messages or comments) are moderated before they are made available online, both to ensure constructive discussion and to minimise the risk that users accidentally post information that identifies themselves or others. Moderators can do one of three things: (1) accept a post without any changes; (2) modify a post according to our [Code of Conduct](#good_practices); (3) reject a post, in which case the post will be permanently deleted. New (moderated) messages and comments are released through [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) three-times-a-day from Sunday to Thursday, at 9am, 1pm and 5pm. The moderators for this deployment of [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) are volunteer sessional tutors from the Faculty of Information Technology at ORGANISATION. Messages and comments are moderated independently by the moderators, and if any disagreements arise (eg. edits or rejections) they will be resolved by the moderation team via video conferencing. Posts (or edited posts) on which moderators cannot agree will be rejected. As all posts in [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) are anonymous, moderators have no way to identify the authors of messages or comments.

## 5. How do I know this is anonymous and secure?

[{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) uses industry grade encryption ([Advanced Encryption Standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/54531.html)) to ensure that all data transferred is secure. Additionally, all connections to [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) are made using the [HTTPS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) protocol. The private link is generated randomly and is not linked to your email address in any way, and we do not keep a record of the email addresses that have either requested a link or have been sent a link. There are no user accounts or other mechanisms to identify people who have used the system. For this deployment we will be monitoring the number of users to assess the level of engagement, however, this information is based on sessions and not on your email address so users will still be anonymous. [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) is hosted on servers that are external to Monash eSolutions, the Faculty of Information Technology and ORGANISATION. If you go to "[Settings](../system/settings)" (once you have accessed the system) you can change the email address to which private links (which you use to access [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/)) are sent – from your ORGANISATION email account to your personal email account. Once this request has been verified, all future personal links (by which you access the system) will be sent to your private email account.

## 6. I do not have a personal email address, is it risky using my ORGANISATION email?

No, however, there is always the possibility that another person can access your ORGANISATION email account and would be able to identify that you have been accessing [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/). Such monitoring would normally be in breach of data protection legislation, unless there were exceptional circumstances (e.g. the investigation of serious crime). Of course, even if you do believe that someone is monitoring your email then the most they would be able to discover is that you have accessed [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) (e.g. to read other people's posts) and the approximate date and time at which you did so. They would not be able to identify what you have read or posted. If you want to change the email that private links to access the system are sent to (e.g. use Gmail or Hotmail instead of your ORGANISATION email) then you can do this on the “[Settings](../system/settings)” page (once you have accessed the system for the first time).

## 7. Who can see the messages on the system?

Newly posted messages are queued for moderation and are not immediately displayed. Batches of moderated messages are posted three-times-a-day from Sunday to Thursday, at 9am, 1pm and 5pm. If posts are published (either as originally posted or in a modified form agreed on by the moderators) then any other user of [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) can read them, comment on them, and vote them up or down. While there is no way that users of [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) can be prevented from re-publishing messages and comments (for example, on other social media platforms) we strongly recommend that people do not do this.

## 8. Great, I am happy that OURVOICE.app is safe and secure. How do I get started?

Any at ORGANISATION can access the system.

- (a) Go to [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/)
- (b) Type in your ORGANISATION email address .
- (c) [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) will immediately send a private link to your ORGANISATION email account (this may take up to five minutes to arrive depending on how busy the email service is at the time). For some users this mail maybe detected as SPAM so check your SPAM or JUNK folders if you have not received the message.
- (d) Clicking on the private link in the email will give you full access to [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/). You can then read and comment on messages, post your own messages and comments, and up- and down-vote messages.
- (e) The private link can only be used once, so once you have left [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) you will need to re-enter you ORGANISATION email in order to receive a new private link with which to access the system.
- (f) If you want to change the email that future private links are sent to (e.g. use a personal Gmail or Hotmail instead of your ORGANISATION email) then you can do this on the “[Settings](../system/settings)” page.

## 9. How are the messages and comments organised?

When you access [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) using a private link, you’ll be able to see all the current messages and comments. Messages are initially organised according to categories that the Faculty is particularly interested to learn more about. There is also an "Other" category where you can discuss anything else, and where you can post a message to request a new category. Within each category, users can anonymously create new messages, post comments, vote each message up or down, and participate in polls (if we use them in this deployment).

## 10. I am ready to post a message. Are there any restrictions on what I can write?

Users of [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) are asked to follow our code of conduct:

- (a) **Truthfulness and honesty**. [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) is not intended to be a rumour mill. Please ensure that you have good reason to believe that what you are posting is actually true. Posts based upon first-hand experience, documentary evidence, or material that you have heard from multiple reliable sources are more likely to be true.
- (b) **Being constructive**. When writing a post, please consider carefully how it might contribute to a discussion. Posts that are unnecessarily adversarial will be edited or rejected. It is also important to consider the wider consequences of what you are saying. [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) is in practice a public forum, so what is published could have direct implications for other members of the community (staff and stakeholders).
- (c) **Anonymity**. A poorly drafted post risks exposing the identity of the author. Even if you are not concerned about your identity being revealed [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) is intended to be an anonymous forum for communication. Phrasing, names, dates and references to small groups of people or specific places can all provide clues to the identity of the author and risk [jigsaw identification](http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/jigsaw-identification). For example, rather than stating that “I am an employee for the NAME OF DEPARTMENT for World Domination unit and was told by Dr Strange to...”, instead say that “I know an employee who was told by their CE to…”. The latter does not reference a specific unit or person but still makes the point.

Following these guidelines will help ensure that your posts are published without any modification by the moderators; although you can be reassured that the moderators will act to protect your identity too. Only the volunteer moderators will have access to unmoderated posts. All original versions of moderated posts, as well as rejected posts, are permanently deleted.

## 11. Isn’t OURVOICE.app a research project?

This deployment of [{{frontmatter.deployment}}](/) is not part of a research project. However, the system itself is one of the outcomes of Dinislam Abdulgalimov's ongoing PhD research at Action Lab, in the Department of Human-Centred Technology, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University. Dinislam’s research is fully funded by the Faculty of Information Technology and explores how digital technologies can be utilised to support employee voice (in this case your own Faculty). If you’d like to learn more about this research read Dinislam’s arXiv preprint of [“Designing for Employee Voice”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02976.pdf), to be published in the proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computer Systems (CHI2020).

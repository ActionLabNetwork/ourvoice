# Aspiring Leaders OurVoice Community Platform Information

## **What is OurVoice?**

DCA is collaborating with Action Lab at Monash University to give CARM women participants across four pilot organisations the opportunity to take part in an online message board and forum on the OurVoice digital platform. This is an exploratory activity in the RISE project - the OurVoice platform aims to create a safe space for CARM women to discuss their views on systemic barriers and enablers to Culturally and Racially Marginalised Women’s progression to leadership positions in their organisations.

This collaborative activity has ethics approval from the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (Project ID: 38763)

## **What does participation involve?**

The RISE Project team will email all participants with a link to access the OurVoice platform. Enter your email address to receive a one-time non-reusable link to access the system. Participating CARM women will be given the opportunity to read the consent form for the OurVoice platform and to accept the form prior to logging into the platform for the first time.  To maintain anonymity, participants will be given a new ‘name’ (pseudonym) each time they join the message board.

Once participants join the message board, they will have a chance to post messages to reply to key questions on the message board. All users are assigned different randomly generated nicknames every time they log-in to ensure anonymity.  Automated system posts will ask participants about particular aspects of racism and discrimination in the workplace, such as 'Is your workplace a safe space for culturally and racially marginalised women?' and participants can respond or comment on a response.

The system will also feature polls where participants can vote on polls such as 'My workplace has procedures in place for handling racism' (Yes, No, Not Sure). Participants can post as many messages as they like in reply to the questions on the message board.

As with any message board/internet forum you can choose your level of involvement. This may involve you posting daily and responding to other users’ posts on the platform, or you may choose to just read other posts and not engage. As the platform is anonymous, we will not be able to know your level of engagement.

Participants will have access to the message board/forum for two (2) weeks, after which the message board/forum will close.

Each message that participants post will be moderated by a small team of moderators before it appears on the message board – so messages will not appear instantly but may take a few hours or up to a day to appear. The moderators will be from the OurVoice Action Lab team at Monash University and may include members of the RISE team at DCA and SSI They will initiate anonymous polls, access raw messages and comments, check for self-disclosure or violation of the platform’s code of conduct, and edit, approve or reject messages for publication on the message board/forum.

Please note that any disclosures of potentially illegal or harmful behaviour in your workplace will be moderated and not posted on the platform. This is due to the need to preserve the safety and anonymity of all CARM women using the platform. Due to the platform’s anonymity, it is not possible for us to follow up on or report disclosures of illegal or harmful activity in workplaces. CARM women using the platform are encouraged to use their organisation’s reporting processes for illegal or harmful activity. Participants are also encouraged to seek support from relevant support services (see project information for the contacts of support services).

## **Who can take part in the OurVoice platform?**

Any CARM woman participating in the three pilot organisations of the RISE project can take part in the OurVoice platform – there will be up to 50 CARM women from the three organisations participating in the platform.

## **What will happen after the OurVoice platform closes?**

All the messages posted on the OurVoice platform will be downloaded and analysed by the OurVoice and RISE teams to identify key themes in the responses. As noted, participants’ responses will already be anonymised when they are posted. The analysis will inform an aggregated report (where the responses of all women from all three pilot organisations will be combined and reported as a group), which will summarise CARM women’s views on systemic barriers and enablers for CARM women’s progression to leadership.

Participants will have the opportunity to co-design key elements of this report prior to it being shared with Pilot organisations’ staff.

The RISE team will finalise the report, taking into account participants’ preferences, and share it with your organisation and the other Pilot organisations before they put together the action plan.

Following the closing of the message board, The OurVoice Action Lab team will contact 10 random participants to be interviewed about their experiences of the platform. These ten participants will be given separate information and consent forms for the interviews.

DCA and the Our Voice Action Lab Team may also report on findings in the report in academic and other publications.

## **What will happen to the information in your responses?**

The OurVoice Platform doesn’t store users’ account details or any metadata. All the collected data will be encrypted and stored within a secure Diversity Council Australia server (Google Cloud). Access to the collected data will be granted only to members of the research team and co-investigators from Diversity Council Australia.

## **Are there risks and benefits to participating on the platform?**

Key benefits include:

- Access to a safe anonymous space with other CARM women to discuss systemic barriers and enablers in progression to leadership.
- Experiences of solidarity and support through sharing experiences with other CARM women in a racially safe space
- Early findings from previous deployments of the OurVoice platform indicate that the slow nature of the posts – due to their moderation and release on the platform creates a more constructive dialogue.

**Risks include:**

- Breach of anonymity: There is a risk that participants may include identifying details about their organisation or location – that may make it easier to identify them individually. This risk will be addressed through careful moderation of messages and removing any information that can lead to breach of anonymity. i. Responses will also be further de-identified before they are analyses and summarised in an aggregated report.
- Participants may experience distress or discomfort due to views shared on the platform: This risk will be minimised and addressed through the moderation of messages posted on the platform.
